# Unlocking Workforce Insights: HR Database Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a deep dive into HR analytics, transforming raw employee data into powerful insights that drive strategic decision-making. By leveraging SQL for data transformation and analytics, this project uncovers trends in employee demographics, hiring, retention, and attrition.

## Key Features & SQL Operations
### Database Creation & Cleaning
- Designed and structured the `hr_db` database.
- Standardized date formats (`birthdate`, `hire_date`, `termdate`) for consistency.
- Resolved column inconsistencies (`id` â†’ `emp_id`).
- Added an `age` column to analyze workforce demographics.
- Enabled safe updates and ensured data integrity.

### Data Analysis & Insights
1. **Employee Demographics:**
   - Gender & Ethnicity distribution.
   - Identifying youngest & oldest employees.
   - Number of employees under 18.

2. **Department & Role-Based Analysis:**
   - Workforce distribution across departments.
   - Promotion trends based on tenure & job role.
   - Time-to-promotion analysis for leadership roles.

3. **Attrition & Retention Trends:**
   - Average tenure per department.
   - Employee churn prediction using tenure & termination data.
   - Peak hiring trends by year & month.

4. **Advanced Workforce Analytics:**
   - Department-wise average tenure insights.
   - Predicting attrition using tenure and department trends.
   - Identifying seasonal hiring patterns.
   - Employee churn prediction based on hire date, term date, and department.

## Technologies Used
- **MySQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and advanced analytics.
- **SQL Queries**: Complex filtering, grouping, and trend analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Formatting**: `STR_TO_DATE()`, `DATE_FORMAT()`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF()` for accurate date transformations.

## Key SQL Queries & Insights

### 1. Employee Demographics Breakdown
```sql
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS count FROM hr WHERE age > 18 GROUP BY gender;
SELECT race, COUNT(*) AS count FROM hr WHERE age >= 18 GROUP BY race ORDER BY count DESC;
```
Understanding workforce diversity and inclusivity.

### 2. Department-Wise Employee Count
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM hr GROUP BY department;
```
Aids in workforce planning and resource allocation.

### 3. Predicting Employee Attrition
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, COALESCE(termdate, CURDATE()))) AS avg_tenure,
SUM(CASE WHEN termdate IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_exits
FROM hr
GROUP BY department ORDER BY avg_tenure ASC;
```
Highlights departments with high turnover rates.

### 4. Promotion Trends Analysis
```sql
SELECT jobtitle, department, COUNT(*) AS promotions_count FROM hr
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURDATE()) > 5
GROUP BY jobtitle, department ORDER BY promotions_count DESC;
```
Determines promotion frequency across job roles and departments.

### 5. Hiring Trends & Peak Hiring Periods
```sql
SELECT YEAR(hire_date) AS hire_year, MONTH(hire_date) AS hire_month, COUNT(*) AS hires
FROM hr GROUP BY hire_year, hire_month ORDER BY hire_year DESC, hire_month DESC;
```
Analyzes hiring trends to optimize recruitment strategies.

### 6. Time-to-Promotion Analysis
```sql
SELECT jobtitle, department, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURDATE())) AS avg_years_to_promotion
FROM hr WHERE jobtitle LIKE '%Manager%' OR jobtitle LIKE '%Lead%'
GROUP BY jobtitle, department ORDER BY avg_years_to_promotion ASC;
```
Provides insights into leadership development pathways.

### 7. Employee Churn Prediction
```sql
SELECT emp_id, first_name, last_name, department, jobtitle,
       TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURDATE()) AS tenure_years,
       (CASE 
           WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURDATE()) < 2 THEN 'Less than 2 years'
           ELSE '2 years or more'
        END) AS tenure_category
FROM hr
ORDER BY tenure_years ASC;
```
Identifies early attrition risks for proactive employee retention.
